In Figure 2.1(a) we display an estimate ${ }^{1}$ of the probability density function of U.S. wage rates in $2009 .$ We see that the density is peaked around $\$ 15$, and most of the probability mass appears to lie between $\$ 10$ and $\$ 40$. These are ranges for typical wage rates in the U.S. population.

Important measures of central tendency are the median and the mean. The median $m$ of a continuous distribution $F$ is the unique solution to

$$
F(m)=\frac{1}{2} .
